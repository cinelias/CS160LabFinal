# CS160LabFinal
Creates a repository for my computer science 160 lab coffee order software

This repository contains the code for a coffee order software developed as for my CS-160 Lab at SDSU. The software is designed to provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for customers to place coffee orders and manage inventory.

Getting Started
To run the coffee order software, follow steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
3. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the cloned repository directory or run this within your IDE

Thank you for everything!
